# Vimium New Tab Page

This is designed to be used in tandem with the [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) extension.

This extension opens new tabs with Vimium's blank new tab page. The new tab page retains keyboard
focus, and Vimium commands can be used immediately.

If desired, the URL for the new tab page can be changed to any URL in this extension's options page.
