# Vimium New Tab Page

This is designed to be used in tandem with the [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) browser
extension.

This browser extension opens new tabs using Vimium's blank new tab page. As a result, the browser's
new tab page will retain keyboard focus, and Vimium commands can be used immediately.

If desired, the URL for the new tab page can be configured in this extension's options page.
